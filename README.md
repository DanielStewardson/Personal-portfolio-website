Personal portfolio website
=========================================

Even though I don't have anything to show off _**yet**_.

**WIP**

Currently in progress but eventually site will incluce:
  - Links to projects/work/gitHub
  - Some smooth JS examples
  - Some personal stylage
  - A widget to transform site into a more standard style (for those that cant handle the retro)
  - Responsive and mobile adaptions
  - Contact form
  - Interactive or at least moving background img
